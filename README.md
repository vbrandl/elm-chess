# Elm Chess

A simple chess SPA implemented in Elm. An (maybe out-of-date) version of the
app can be found [here](https://static.vbrandl.net/chess.html).

## TODO

Not all rules are implemented yet:

- [X] Only allow valid moves (e.g. you cannot be in check after moving)
- [X] Trade pawns
- [ ] Castling
- [ ] En-passant capturing
- [ ] Efficient decision if in checkmate
